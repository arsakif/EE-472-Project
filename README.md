# EE-472-Project

EE-472 Power System Analysis II -- Solving Power Flow Problem with Newton - Rapson Method
Mar 2019 â€“ May 2019
Project descriptionwe studied how to utilize an IEEE common data format (CDF) text file to acquire
information and use it to build YBUS by writing a computer program for a given power system.
This data and YBUS are used to solve power flow problem with Newton-Rapson iteration to find out 
the bus voltage magnitudes and angles. As computation tool MATLAB is used for both projects.
